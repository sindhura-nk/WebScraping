Hi, 

The approach I used to solve this assignment is:
	1. I have used beautiful soup to extract article title and text content from the URL's provided in input file.
	2. I have saved all the text content into a text file with URL_ID as filename.
	3. I have used nltk, nltk pyphen module to 
		a) remove stopwords
		b) count syllables
	4. I have used regex to identify personal pronouns and also to remove punchuation from words 
	5. Calculated all the required variables and stored them in a dictionary
	5. Converted the end result dictionary to DataFrame and saved the output results to 'Output Data Structure.xlsx' file.

Please follow the below instructions to run 'webscraping_article_title_&_text' .py file

1. Open the '.py' file in vscode.Replace all the below file paths to where it is saved at your end.
	Input.xlsx
	StopWords
	MasterDictionary
2. Dependencies: Install packages if not present in python directory
	pip install beautifulsoup4 requests	
	pip install nltk
	pip install nltk pyphen
	pip install openpyxl
3. Open the terminal, select command prompt and run the file using py 'webscraping_article_title_&_text'.py
4. Once, the file gets executed successfully, you can find the output excel file in the same folder.
	Output Data Structure.xlsx
